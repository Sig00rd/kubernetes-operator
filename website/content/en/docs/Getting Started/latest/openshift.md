    Running Jenkins Operator on OpenShift
---

## Release 0.7.0 is not compatible with OpenShift.
If you are using OpenShift and would like to see Jenkins Operator support it, you're welcome to voice your opinion in
[Jenkins Operator category] of Jenkins Community Discourse.
However, please understand that running Jenkins on Kubernetes takes priority over OpenShift for this project.
